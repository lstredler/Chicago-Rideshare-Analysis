Which month are drivers busiest? (March 2020) (bar chart) - Rachel 
March 2019 vs March 2020 rideshare use during the pandemic (bar chart) - Rachel 
March 2019 vs March 2020 average tip percent? - Thomas

Tips
Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
(Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.
