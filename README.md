## Conclusions 📊
* Most Frequent Distance to travel was between 1-2 Miles and the furthest distance traveled in March 2020 was 355.3 Miles.
* Most trips were within a few areas clustered around downtown, and there’s a slight correlation between number of rideshare pickups and an area’s median annual income.
* The most common vehicle used for rideshare in Chicago is Toyota Camry and the most common color is black.
* The rideshare drivers are living predominantly in the north side of the city around Lincoln Square area. 
* We can demonstrate that use of rideshare services fell after lockdown orders were put in place.
