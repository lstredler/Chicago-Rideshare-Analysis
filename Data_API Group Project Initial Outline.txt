Project Title: Chicago Rideshare Analysis


Team Names:
* Uber fun team
* Team arriving in 2 minutes
* Uplyfting data


Team Members Group 2:
* Kiril Ivanov
* Lauren Stredler
* Rachel Thorpe (she/her)
* Scott Gall (he/him)
* Thomas Westerkamp


Project Description/Outline:
* Using publicly available data provided by the City of Chicago, our group plans to analyze questions about transportation network providers (rideshare apps).


Research Questions to Answer: (can be year specific - 2020)
1. Most popular pickup/drop off locations(lat/long) (2020)(gmap option - heat map) - Scott
2. Which zipcode(s) are most drivers from? (bar chart) - Kiril 
3. Most popular make, model, color of rideshare vehicles(2020) (bar chart) - Kiril 
4. Outliers for longest/shortest ride (in 2020) (scatter plot) - Lauren 
5. Average distance or time for rides (in 2020) (gmap option) -  Lauren 
6. Which month are drivers busiest? (in 2020) (bar chart) - Rachel 
7. 2019 vs 2020 rideshare use during the pandemic (bar chart) - Rachel 
8. 2019 vs 2020 average tip percent? - Thomas 
9. Any correlation between fare and tip? - Thomas 


Potential Bonus 
1. TBD - Any correlation between ride frequency and weather (weather API)

City of Chicago Transportation providers (rideshare) driver data: 
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Drivers/j6wf-834c


2020 specific City of Chicago Transportation providers (rideshare) trip data: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips-2020/rmc8-eqv4 


2019 specific City of Chicago Transportation providers (rideshare) trip data: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Transportation-Network-Providers-Trips-2019/iu3g-qa69 




Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
1. Assign owner of repo - Lauren (Done)
2. Create repo (Done)
3. Add group members (Done)
4. Start branches (Scott started)
5. Assign questions (Done)
6. Assign ownership of datasets (Done - based on questions outlined)
7. Clean datasets
8. Merge datasets (possible to merge on shared columns)


Tips
* Use Pandas to clean and format your dataset(s). 
* Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the data exploration and cleanup process.
* Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the final data analysis. 
* Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6–8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per ”question” you ask of your data). 
* Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation. 
* (Optional) Use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions.
* Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each “question” you asked of your data and a short description of your findings and any relevant plots.

Questions you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them
* Our questions are based on data that we thought would be useful to rideshare app users. These questions were about common themes like most popular rideshare vehicle, data about popular trips, far and tip data, and information about drivers. 


Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions
* We found our data on the data.cityofchicago.org website, and some cleaned versions of those datasets on kaggle.
